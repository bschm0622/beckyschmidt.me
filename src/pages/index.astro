			<h1>Hi, there ðŸ‘‹</h1>
			<p>
				Thanks for visiting my personal website! I'm Becky. For the past
				4 years, I've worked as a product manager at
				<a href="https://octane11.com">Octane11</a>, a B2B SaaS startup.
				Outside of work, you can find me on walks with my family,
				listening to my favorite podcasts, meeting friends at a coffee
				shop (for the vibes, not the coffee), gathering eggs from my
				backyard chickens, or playing a board game.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm endlessly curious about the world and the people in it,
				because I know we were placed in this moment in time for a
				reason. Recently, that's looked like pursuing my own <a
					href="/projects">side projects</a
				>, creating websites and apps with AI.
			</p>
			<p>
				I also post on my <a href="/blog">blog</a> here and there, and you
				can find all sorts of experimental things at my random collection
				of <a href="slash-pages">slash pages</a>, inspired by <a
					href="https://slashpages.net/">slashpages.net</a
				>.
