# My work

## Day job

I'm a Senior Product Manager at [Octane11](https://octane11.com), where I own our core data & AI products. I was the second product and seventh overall hire.

I start with discovery - prototyping features in Figma and Claude Code, testing ideas with users, and using SQL to question assumptions. I get curious about the gaps between what users think they need and what the data shows. The interesting challenge is helping B2B marketers prove the value of their efforts - showing they're reaching target accounts and influencing real deals by turning signals from all their marketing channels into clear attribution.

I work closely with engineering to turn those prototypes into shipped features, staying hands-on through technical specs, QA, and release. I help the team understand user needs and make good product decisions, which means I'm in the details - writing SQL to prototype data models, reviewing code for edge cases, and testing features before they ship. Post-launch, I enable sales and marketing to effectively communicate the value to customers through release notes and knowledge base updates.

Some career highlights:
- **AI product suite:** Own the roadmap for our AI assistant (powered by our proprietary dataset) and AI-enabled user tools. Prototyped the UX in Claude Code and designed with familiar patterns to make the interface intuitive.
- **Data products:** Own data blending logic that chooses the best account match across multiple vendors (50% signal increase) and "key moments" detection that surfaces critical touchpoints in the customer journey.
- **Product partnerships:** Led integrations with LinkedIn's Company Intelligence API (130%+ signal lift) and The Trade Desk REDS, handling both technical scoping and business development.
- **Internal tools:** Built AI-powered tools to reduce operational overhead, including Google Apps Scripts, YouTrack automations, and Slack workflows that save our team hours weekly.

## Side projects

I started building in early 2025, going from never coding before to my first app deployed in a month. Here's what I've shipped so far:

- **[BiblePlan](https://bibleplan.app?ref=personal-website-work)**: Flexible Bible reading plans - choose any books, any timeframe, skip days to make it sustainable. 100 users, 70% activation.
- **[SplitReceipts](https://splitreceipts.com?ref=personal-website-work)**: Receipt scanner - upload a photo, get line items broken out and categorized.
- **[Wellspring Archive](https://wellspringarchive.com?ref=personal-website-work)**: Christian podcast directory
- **[Teeth Whitening Find](https://teethwhiteningfind.com?ref=personal-website-work)**: Find and compare teeth whitening providers
- **[GolfSim Find](https://golfsimfind.com?ref=personal-website-work)**: Golf simulator finder
- **[hey, pal creative](https://heypalcreative.co)**: Marketing site for a friend's videography agency

...and a bunch of other experiments that didn't make it out of GitHub.
