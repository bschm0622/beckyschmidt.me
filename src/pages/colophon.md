# Colophon

I develop this site in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code), which allows me to happily overengineer this website to my heart's content. Version control is managed with [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).

The site is built on the [Astro framework](https://astro.build/) and styled with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). The font is [Karla](https://fontsource.org/fonts/karla), icons are from [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/), and it's deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Features

- **Real-time reactions** - [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/) database powers the reactions you can see at the bottom of each blog post
- **Custom CMS** - Built with the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) so I can create new blog posts without pulling my codebase down locally
- **Static search** - [Pagefind](https://github.com/shishkin/astro-pagefind) powers the site search
- **Reading time** - [reading-time](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reading-time) plugin estimates how long each blog post takes to read
- **RSS feed** - [astro-rss](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/packages/astro-rss) generates the RSS feed
- **Analytics** - [Umami](https://umami.is/) provides privacy-friendly analytics
- **SEO** - [Astro Sitemap](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/packages/integrations/sitemap/) generates the sitemap
