This [tweet](https://x.com/justinbieber/status/1997125645437194682) from Justin Bieber blew up on X, particularly amongst design and product management folks.

Some of my favorite comments:
> you’re officially invited to our weekly design crits

> Bieber has entered his product management era.
>
> Next, tell them it shouldn’t take multiple taps to switch tabs in Safari.

>Now do one on the photos app UX!

Everyone has basic product sense. We all know what it's like to open a brand new app and have no idea where to click, what to do, how to navigate. Justin's own comment: "The send button should not have multiple functions in the same spot."
