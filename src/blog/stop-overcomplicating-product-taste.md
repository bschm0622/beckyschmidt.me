This [tweet](https://x.com/justinbieber/status/1997125645437194682) from Justin Bieber blew up on X, particularly amongst design and product management folks.

Yes, Justin Bieber is one of the biggest celebrities in the world. But the tweet didn’t go viral just because he’s famous. It resonated because it captured something true about modern software: everyone uses apps, everyone has seen the same UX patterns, and everyone has developed a baseline level of product sense.

So what separates basic product sense from actual product taste?

Product sense feels that something is off, that friction is in the system somewhere.

Product taste is the judgment to decide what the interaction *should* do and the discipline to protect that simplicity from every team, feature, and edge case trying to complicate it.

In other words, sense identifies the problem. Taste chooses the right solution. 

This is where people start overcomplicating taste. Yes, some teams are inventing brand-new interactions. But most products aren’t creating a new category - they should be reusing the patterns that already live in a user’s muscle memory.

The best product taste is simple and disciplined. And ironically, that’s why it’s so rare today. Teams are trading taste for MVP checkboxes, “move fast and break things,” and shipping for the sake of shipping. And their users are paying the price.

## Recovering judgement
