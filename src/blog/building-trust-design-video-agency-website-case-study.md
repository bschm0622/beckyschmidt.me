## **The opportunity**

After spending a few months learning web development, I was eager to apply my skills to a real project. When my childhood friend Glenn mentioned he was launching a new video production agency, *hey, pal creative*, I saw the perfect opportunity to help while gaining valuable experience.

Glenn and his business partner Jackson were starting from scratch and needed a website to showcase their work and help build credibility.

**Their specific needs:**

* Introduce their brand and services to potential clients  
* Showcase their video production work professionally  
* Provide an easy way for prospects to get in touch

As a new agency, their website would often be the first impression potential clients had of their business. It needed to look professional to compete with established video production companies while reflecting their friendly, collaborative brand personality.

## **The process**

### **Discovery & research**

I started by understanding their market position and target audience. I researched local video production companies to see what worked in their industry, reviewed their existing social media presence to understand their brand voice, and had Glenn share websites he admired. Together, we identified key elements that resonated with their potential clients.

### **Design & planning**

I created a Figma mockup that incorporated their existing brand assets \- logo, colors, and fonts. We collaborated on developing copy that was friendly and conversational, matching their *hey, pal* brand voice.

### **Development & iteration**

Rather than using a page builder like WordPress or Wix, I opted for custom development. This approach delivered faster performance, perfect brand alignment (no template constraints), future scalability as their business grows, and eliminated ongoing subscription fees.

The technical development took about a week of focused work time. I created five strategic sections that work together to build credibility and guide visitors toward contact:

1. **Hero section** \- Clear value proposition with immediate call-to-action  
2. **Portfolio showcase** \- Diverse work samples with external links  
3. **Services explanation** \- What services they offer on a high level  
4. **Personal connection** \- Individual team bios and contact info to build trust  
5. **Contact form** \- Streamlined inquiry process

**Key technical features:**

* Context-aware navigation with smooth scroll animations  
* Mobile-first responsive design with optimized images  
* Consistent branding and cohesive visual identity throughout

### **Review & launch**

We used Figma and the hosting platform’s preview functionality for client feedback, allowing real-time collaboration on final tweaks. The entire project spanned about four months from start to finish, working around everyone's schedules and allowing time for thoughtful revisions.

## **The results**

Glenn and Jackson now have a professional website that:

- Loads incredibly fast (98 Lighthouse score)  
- Establishes credibility with potential clients  
- Provides a clear path for inquiries  

The site showcases their work effectively while reflecting their friendly, collaborative brand personality - exactly what they needed to compete in their market.  

> "Becky was able to capture, with very little prompting, the exact style and feeling we wanted to convey as a company. When we saw the first draft of the site, we felt like she had read our minds. She helped us craft the structure, copy, design, and tone of the site with intentionality and an open, collaborative spirit. It's a simple, beautiful website, and we could not be happier."
