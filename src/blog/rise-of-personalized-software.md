## Why I'm betting on personalized software over SaaS

Three days and $20. That's what it cost me to build a task management app that works exactly how I think, after years of trying everything from Notion to Todoist without finding something that clicked with my workflow.

I'm not a developer. I just clearly defined what I wanted, then let AI handle the rest - writing code, debugging, deploying. You can try the result at [home.beckyschmidt.me](https://home.beckyschmidt.me) (full write-up coming soon on how I did it), but the tool itself isn't the point.

The point is what this represents: until now, we've accepted that every software subscription gives us roughly 80% of what we want because building custom software required teams of developers, months of work, and ongoing maintenance costs. Consumer apps are generic. Enterprise software promises customization but delivers complexity and bloat.

But the economics just flipped. While SaaS companies must build for broad market appeal to achieve scale, carrying high customer acquisition costs and feature compromises, custom software has zero acquisition costs with perfect product-market fit for an audience of one.

[Sam Altman predicts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5vsEUgxt3E) we'll see a one-person billion-dollar company soon, but I think there's a more immediate and practical opportunity: regular people and companies replacing their SaaS subscriptions at a fraction of the cost with personalized alternatives they can build to their exact specs and own forever.

This isn't speculation - just peruse LinkedIn and every day you'll see posts like [this one from Klarna's CEO](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastian-siemiatkowski-768977_sorry-jira-bitbucket-and-atlassian-you-are-activity-7363555407107145730-eTJl?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABYyuN8BiBAN0-xUJvZwebVfsZH4peYEMsg) replacing Jira with an in-house solution. The pattern is accelerating as more people discover how accessible custom software has become.

## What remains defensible

Not all software categories face the same threat. I'm seeing three types of categories that remain defensible:

**Network-dependent platforms** like messaging apps, social networks, and marketplaces survive because their value comes from other users being there. You can't replicate Instagram's network by building a better photo app.

**Compliance-heavy enterprise software** in healthcare, finance, and government will resist AI-generated alternatives for years. When regulatory approval processes take longer than AI development cycles, established vendors maintain significant advantages.

**Ecosystem orchestration platforms** that manage complex vendor relationships and enterprise partnerships. Building better project management features is easy; rebuilding Stripe's relationships with banks, payment processors, and regulatory bodies across 50 countries is not.

## The transition is already underway

Smart SaaS companies are already recognizing this shift. Some are pivoting toward providing the infrastructure and APIs that power custom software rather than competing with it. Others are doubling down on network effects and ecosystem plays.

The companies that don't adapt will face a new type of churn: customers who don't switch to competitors but simply stop needing their category entirely. When your customer can build exactly what they need instead of settling for what you offer, retention becomes an entirely different challenge.

For everyone else, the opportunity is exciting. The software you actually want - the one that matches your workflow, integrates with your specific tools, and includes only the features you need - is now buildable. The question isn't whether this shift will happen, but how quickly you'll take advantage of it.
