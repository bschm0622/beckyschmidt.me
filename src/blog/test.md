## The distribution dilemma led me to personal software

I've been experimenting with AI-powered development since early 2025, initially chasing the dream of building apps for everyone. The promise was simple: any idea can be improved upon and you can become a solo founder with just an internet connection and a $20 subscription.

But after launching several [projects](https://beckyschmidt.me/projects), I hit the same challenge that every founder faces - distribution. Building a "better Notion" or "cheaper CRM" means nothing if you can't get users. Even if you build something amazing, product-led growth requires actual marketing and sales, not just launching something into the void.

I'm still tinkering with many of those projects, but this realization shifted my focus from building for everyone to building for one person: myself. As a product manager with a growing family, my mental to-do list was becoming unmanageable. Despite trying everything from pen and paper to Todoist, nothing clicked with my natural workflow - a kanban board with a backlog.

Three days and $20 later, I have a working personal productivity app that I actually love using. You can try it at [home.beckyschmidt.me](https://home.beckyschmidt.me), but that's not the focus, because I built that software just for me. The point is what this represents: **we're entering an era where personalized software trumps one-size-fits-all solutions**.

While [Sam Altman predicts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5vsEUgxt3E) we'll see a one-person billion-dollar company soon, I think the more immediate opportunity is regular people and companies replacing their SaaS subscriptions with personalized alternatives they can build to their exact specs and own forever.

## How I built it (The short version)

The key to successful AI-powered development is coming prepared. I started with ChatGPT, clearly defining my problem, desired solution, and technical preferences. This upfront planning paid dividends when I moved to Claude Code, and saved valuable tokens.

With a detailed plan in hand, Claude Code took over - writing code, debugging, and implementing features. Within hours, I had a functional app, and within three days, the app was published online.

I'll be writing a detailed technical walkthrough in my next post for those who want the full step-by-step process.

## The 80% problem is ending

Today, every SaaS subscription gives you roughly 80% of what you want. Consumer software like Gmail and Spotify work, but they all could be *better*. Enterprise software promises more customization but delivers complexity. We've accepted these compromises because the alternative - creating and maintaining our own software - was impossible for individuals, and distracting for businesses.

That calculation is changing. AI can now handle the entire software lifecycle: coding, testing, security checks, and deployment for cheap. When you're building for yourself or your company, you can create exactly what you need, not what scales to millions of users.

The economics explain this well - traditional SaaS companies need thousands of users to justify building features, carrying high customer acquisition costs and compromise-heavy roadmaps. Personal software flips this entirely - zero acquisition costs with perfect product-market fit for an audience of one.

I'm already seeing companies replace expensive SaaS contracts with custom solutions built by product managers and sales reps in their spare time. This isn't theoretical - it's happening now.

## What survives the personalization wave

Not every software category will be disrupted immediately. I'm seeing four types of applications that remain defensible:

**Network effect applications** like Slack or Instagram survive because their value comes from other users. You may be able to clone an app in a day, but you can't clone its user base.

**Highly regulated enterprise software** serving healthcare, finance, and government will take years to adapt to AI-generated solutions. Compliance requirements and risk tolerance favor established vendors.

**Collaboration-heavy platforms** where multiple organizations need to coordinate will maintain their moats through ecosystem effects.

**Ecosystem orchestration platforms** that depend on complex vendor relationships and enterprise partnerships. You can build the interface, but you can't replicate years of business development and API negotiations.

## The tide is coming

Today, I suspect companies like Todoist and Notion are losing customers to personalized alternatives, though it’s likely not showing in their metrics yet. Smart incumbents are already looking for their next competitive edge, because staying ahead of AI-powered competitors will require constant innovation.

The future isn’t about replacing all software - it’s about unbundling the monoliths. Just as mobile apps broke apart websites, AI-powered development will break feature-heavy platforms into personalized, purpose-built tools.

Platforms built for everyone will increasingly feel heavy and compromise-filled, while tools designed for specific needs will thrive. The companies that succeed will be those that focus relentlessly on a niche, delivering solutions better than individuals or companies could build for themselves. For individuals and small teams, the lesson is clear: start by building for yourself. Solving your own problem first often provides the clearest guide for what software should become.
