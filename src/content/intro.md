# Hi, I'm Becky.

I'm a product manager at [Octane11](https://octane11.com), where I was the second product hire. I build AI tools and data products that help B2B marketers prove their impact. On the side, I'm building a [Bible reading app](https://bibleplan.app) with 100 lifetime users.

I'm a native Hoosier, living in Indianapolis with my husband, our toddler, and four backyard chickens. When I'm not at work, you can find me tinkering on [side projects](/work#side-projects), getting coffee with a friend, or playing a board game.
