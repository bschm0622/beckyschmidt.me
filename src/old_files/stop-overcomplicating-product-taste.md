This [tweet](https://x.com/justinbieber/status/1997125645437194682) from Justin Bieber blew up on X this week, particularly amongst design and product management folks.

Yes, Justin Bieber is one of the biggest celebrities in the world, but the tweet didn’t go viral just because he’s famous. It resonated because it captured something true about modern software: everyone uses apps, everyone has seen the same UX patterns, and everyone has developed a baseline level of product sense that is now expected in every product.

But if everyone has that sense, why do huge companies like Apple still ship frustrating interactions? The difference is in product taste.

Product sense is noticing when something feels off. Product taste is deciding what it *should* feel like and having the discipline to protect that simplicity from every feature, edge case, and team debate trying to complicate it.

In short: sense identifies the problem, taste chooses the solution. 

This is where people start overcomplicating taste. Yes, some teams are inventing brand-new interactions. But most products aren’t creating a new category - they should be reusing the patterns that already live in a user’s muscle memory.

The best product taste is simple and disciplined, and ironically, that’s why it’s so rare today. Teams are trading taste for MVP checkboxes, “move fast and break things,” and shipping for the sake of shipping. And their users are paying the price.

So what does it look like when a company actually *does* prioritize product taste? Linear is one of the companies that immediately comes to mind. In a blog post entitled *[Why is quality so rare?](https://linear.app/now/why-is-quality-so-rare)*, the CEO of Linear Karri Saarinen summarizes their philosophy:

> I've learned that building quality requires three elements working together: The belief that quality matters fundamentally, the skill and taste to recognize it, and the willingness to care deeply about the user’s experience.

It’s not just about fewer bugs or pixel pushing, but the careful decision-making that creates intentional interaction. Product taste reminds me of careful industrial kitchen design - everything in the perfect place to make orchestrating the meal as seamless as possible.

With AI, shipping fast becomes even more tempting as the cost to build drops dramatically. AI itself isn’t the problem - it’s trained on fundamental UX principles and can help nail basic interactions. What it can’t do is make the judgment calls that separate good from great. AI will build a perfectly functional settings menu, but it won’t question whether you need that settings menu at all, or notice friction that only humans can spot. The product taste is the human fingerprints that come from understanding how real people actually use products, not just textbook principles.

Too often, teams ship fast at the expense of iteration. The MVP is minimally viable — taste is what brings it to life.

The software market is only becoming more competitive. This year, [36 million developers joined GitHub](https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-a-new-developer-joins-github-every-second-as-ai-leads-typescript-to-1/#:~:text=More%20than%2036%20million%20developers%20joined%20GitHub%20in%20a%20single%20year%20(23%25%20YoY)%2C), a 23% increase over 2024, and the pace will only accelerate as AI tools make building faster and easier. The best way to differentiate is to develop and foster product taste that makes your product stand out.

As a product builder, I’ve developed my own taste through a few guiding principles:

- **Simplify interactions** - if there’s a battle-tested UX pattern, use it
- **Add the human fingerprint** - take the baseline pattern and make it even simpler or tailor it to my workflow
- **Bring the team along** - advocate for taste at every turn and secure buy-in to invest the time needed
- **Learn continuously** - study world-class products, internalize patterns, and refine my own
