# Remote Job: Growth Product Manager at Buffer

This job posting is over 30 days old, but the application is still open.

## About The Role

Buffer is a product-led growth (PLG) company. PLG is a growth model that focuses on the _product itself_ as the primary driver of acquisition, retention and expansion.

PLG companies like Buffer often offer a freemium plan, a free trial or some combination of the two. At Buffer, we offer a generous free plan with upgrade ladders, as well as a fully-featured trial. 

As the Growth PM you’ll own Buffer’s freemium experience. More than 100,000 people use our free plan each month. These are your people! You’ll shape the customer journey from free sign-up to paying customer. To do this, you’ll become our resident expert on the free plan, the free experience and the funnels and upgrade paths that lead somebody from free to paid. We strive to offer a generous free plan, while ensuring that our freemium strategy is working for our business.

You will be responsible for ensuring that our users have the best opportunities to upgrade if and when they’d benefit from our paid plans. This includes ensuring the reliability of our upgrade paths, presentation of paid plans, and optimizing CTAs and paywalls that drive consistent improvements to our free and trial conversion rates across Buffer.

This role has a heavy data-driven component as we seek to optimize our free offering for both our customers and our business, so an understanding of SQL is ideal and data analysis chops are a must, along with an extremely curious nature.

You’ll work closely with cross-functional teams at Buffer to align our free experience with our strategic vision, define success criteria, and develop clear plans and milestones for product delivery. Day to day, you’ll work hands on and collaborate with your product team to execute on the roadmap and regularly deliver value to our customers.

Buffer is a data-driven organization with data-insights distributed to all members of the product development and go-to-market process. You will be responsible for instrumentation, accuracy of data and dashboard reporting of Buffer users’ engagement with in-app value discovery and purchase experience. Navigating data integrity, reliability and performant query structure should be second-nature for you.

## Who You'll Work With

In this role you’ll report to the Director of Product. Day to day you’ll lead a Buffer EPD team (Engineering, Product and Design pod), which means you will be supported by a Product Designer, Engineering Manager, and two or three Engineers. 

Where you’ll be focused on in-app activation and conversion, you’ll also work closely with our marketing growth team and data scientists, who are focused primarily on top-of-funnel and acquisition. You will collaborate your roadmaps with our Director of Growth Marketing to ensure cohesion of all growth efforts across Buffer.

As a member of a product management organization you will help shape Buffer’s overall product strategy, end-to-end user experience and growth efforts.
