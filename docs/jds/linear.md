# Product Manager - Linear Careers

At Linear, we are on a mission to bring magic back to software. To empower product teams to do their best work, we are building an issue tracking and project management tool that delivers world-class design, usability, and performance. The emergence of generative AI has supercharged our ability to level up our users’ product development practices.

Linear has been a fully remote company from the start. Today, our team of less than 100 is distributed across North America and Europe. What unites us is relentless focus, fast execution, and our passion for software craftsmanship. We are all makers at heart and care deeply about the quality of our work.

We're looking for a senior to staff level product manager to join the team.

In this role, you'll be responsible for leading the development of products end-to-end, from conception through development and rollout. If you're excited to have a lot of ownership while remaining in the details day to day, this might be a great fit for you.

Linear is a product-led company that focuses on both building and selling. It's up to you to bring together the building and selling sides of the company in order to create something that our customers will love.
